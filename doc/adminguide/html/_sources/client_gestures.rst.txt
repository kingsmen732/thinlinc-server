Client touch gestures
---------------------

The ThinLinc client has support for a number of touch gestures when used
on a touch capable monitor. These gestures allow the user to simulate
certain mouse operations that would otherwise not be possible.

.. note::

   Touch gestures are not available on macOS as it currently lacks
   native support for touch capable monitors.
