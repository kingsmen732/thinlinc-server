   :description: Overview of essential TCP ports used by ThinLinc
                 agents, including SSH, Web Access, and VNC services.

On a machine running VSM Agent
------------------------------

22: SSH daemon
   Just as for the VSM server, there must be an SSH daemon running on
   all VSM agent machines. This daemon is normally listening to port 22,
   although it can listen to other ports as well. See the entry about
   port 22 at :ref:`tcp-ports_vsmserver`.

300: ThinLinc Web Access
   By default, ThinLinc's Web Access service tlwebaccess is available on
   TCP port 300. Traffic to this port is encrypted (TLS).

   .. note::

      The port on which tlwebaccess runs is configurable via the
      parameter :servconf:`/webaccess/listen_port`. See
      :ref:`configuration_tlwebaccess` for details.

904: VSM Agent
   The VSM agent listens on port 904 for incoming requests from the VSM
   server host. The traffic is not encrypted, but the VSM agent only
   allows connections originating from a port lower than 1024, from a
   list of known IP addresses. The protocol in use is XMLRPC through
   HTTP.

1010: ThinLinc web administration interface (tlwebadm)
   By default, ThinLinc's web-based administration interface is
   available on TCP port 1010. See the entry about port 1010 at
   :ref:`tcp-ports_vsmserver`.

5901--5999: VNC servers for first 99 sessions
   Ports 5901--5999 are used by Xvnc processes serving display numbers
   strictly below 100.

4900--5899: Tunnels to clients
   The ports in this interval are used as server-side endpoints for the
   SSH tunnels used to access local resources of the client, for example
   local drives, serial ports and sound.

   This interval is used for sessions with display number strictly below
   100.

   The algorithm used for calculating which ports to use for a specific
   display number in this interval is:

      4900 + *display-id* × 10 + *SERVICE_SLOT*

   where *SERVICE_SLOT* is a number defined under
   :servconf:`/vsm/tunnelservices`.

6001--8000: X display ports
   If Xvnc is configured to listen for incoming TCP requests from X
   Window System clients on other hosts, ports 6001--8000 are used by
   display numbers 1--2000. The default is not to listen for incoming TCP
   requests, so in the default configuration, the ports in this interval
   are not open.

Port 32767 downwards to 11857
   The algorithm described below is used to allocate ports for the Xvnc
   process and for the server-side endpoints for SSH tunnels to access
   local resources of the client. This algorithm is used for sessions
   with display numbers strictly higher than 99.

   Each session is allocated :servconf:`/vsm/tunnelslots_per_session`
   (default value 10) + 1 ports, leading to an allocation of 11 ports
   per session with the default configuration. The ports are allocated
   starting with the port given as
   :servconf:`/vsmagent/max_session_port` (default 32767), and then
   downwards. This means that the ports are aligned upwards as closely
   as possible to the upper limit defined. This is a good practice to
   avoid collisions with other services running on the machine.

   Some examples follow

   Display number 50
      The VNC port will be 5950 which is:

         5900 + *display*.

      The tunnel ports allocated for this display are 5400--5409, which
      is:

         4900 + (10 × *display*) + *SERVICE_SLOT*

      where *SERVICE_SLOT* is 0--9.

   Display number 100, :servconf:`/vsmagent/display_min` = 10 (the default), :servconf:`/vsmagent/max_session_port` = 32767.
      The VNC port will be 32757, which is:

      32767 - ((*display* - 100) ×
      (:servconf:`/vsm/tunnelslots_per_session` + 1) +
      :servconf:`/vsm/tunnelslots_per_session`))

      Ports 32758--32767 (inclusive) will be used for tunnel ports.

   Display number 300, :servconf:`/vsmagent/display_min` = 100, :servconf:`/vsmagent/max_session_port` = 32767 (the default).
      The VNC port will be 30557 which is:

      32767 - ((*display* - 100) ×
      (:servconf:`/vsm/tunnelslots_per_session` + 1) +
      :servconf:`/vsm/tunnelslots_per_session`))

      Ports 30558--30567 (inclusive) will be used for tunnel ports.

   Display number 600, :servconf:`/vsmagent/display_min` = 300, :servconf:`/vsmagent/max_session_port` = 32767 (the default).
      The VNC port will be 29457, which is:

      32767 - ((*display* - 300) ×
      (:servconf:`/vsm/tunnelslots_per_session` + 1) +
      :servconf:`/vsm/tunnelslots_per_session`))

      Ports 29458--29467 (inclusive) will be used for tunnel ports.
