                 clusters, including considerations for configuration
                 migration, license updates, and a step-by-step process
                 for upgrading both master and agent servers in a
                 ThinLinc environment.

Upgrading ThinLinc
------------------

This chapter will detail the process of upgrading ThinLinc servers and
clusters. There are several important items that have to be considered
regarding ThinLinc upgrades:

-  It is required that all servers (including HA nodes) in a cluster are
   running the same ThinLinc version.

-  All ThinLinc services will automatically be stopped during the entire
   upgrade. They will be started again once ThinLinc setup finishes.

-  Users will not be able to reconnect to running sessions when the
   master service is stopped or when the agent service is stopped on the
   agent server running the session.

-  Users will not be able to create new sessions when the master service
   is stopped or when no agent servers are available.

-  Running sessions will be unaffected by a upgrade. This means that
   users can continue working. This also means that running sessions
   will not be getting the benefits from the new version.

.. _upgrade_cluster:

Upgrading a cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The recommended workflow for upgrading a ThinLinc cluster is as follows:

1. Review configuration changes in the release notes for the new
   release. More information regarding configuration migration can be
   found in :ref:`upgrade_migration`.

2. Check licenses and install new ones if needed. For details see
   :ref:`upgrade_licenses`.

3. Schedule the upgrade and if necessary prepare the users on that
   reconnections or creation will be unavailable during the upgrade
   process. The command :program:`tl-notify` can be used to send
   messages to users in running sessions. Documentation for this command
   can be found in :ref:`commands`.

4. Stop the agent services on all agent servers. The command
   :program:`tl-ssh-all` can be used to run commands on all agent
   servers in the cluster. Documentation for this command can be found
   in :ref:`commands`. This step will prevent reconnections and the
   creation of new sessions.

5. Remove all agent servers from the cluster by clearing the
   configuration parameter
   :servconf:`/vsmserver/subclusters/<name>/agents` on the master.
   Details on this parameter can be found in
   :ref:`configuration_subcluster_params`. Restart the master service to
   take the change into effect. If HA is used, do this on both master
   servers.

6. Upgrade the master server. Details for installing an upgrade can be
   found in :ref:`upgrade_packages` and :ref:`upgrade_migration`. If HA
   is used, stop the master service on both master servers and then
   upgrade both servers.

7. Upgrade each agent server and manually add them back into the
   upgraded cluster. Upgrading agents works the same way as upgrading a
   master server. Add each upgraded agent to the configuration parameter
   :servconf:`/vsmserver/subclusters/<name>/agents` on the master.
   Restart the master service afterward. If HA is used, do this on both
   master servers. Once at least one agent is added users will again be
   able to create new sessions.

Once all agent servers are upgraded and added back into the cluster all
users will be able to reconnect to existing sessions and the upgrade is
complete.

.. _upgrade_licenses:

New licenses
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before performing an upgrade the first step is to find out if new
license files are required to run the new version. ThinLinc license
files delivered with version **x.y.z** will still work for versions with
the same **x** and **y** but higher **z**, but not for increased
**x** or **y**. For example, license files for ThinLinc 3.1.0 will still
work for ThinLinc 3.1.1, but not for ThinLinc 3.2.0 or ThinLinc 4.0.0.

As the new licenses will work with the old (current) version, it's a
good idea to install them as the first step in the upgrade process.

.. _upgrade_packages:

Upgrading the package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The same installation program that you used to install ThinLinc is also
used to upgrade it. It is located in the root directory of the server
bundle. Extract the bundle and start the installation program as
follows:

.. code:: console

   $ sh ./install-server

and answer the questions. If you prefer, you can also upgrade the
ThinLinc package by hand. This package is located in the subdirectory
:file:`packages` in the server bundle.

If :program:`install-server` was used, it will ask if ThinLinc setup
should be started at the end of the package upgrade. If ThinLinc setup
wasn't started automatically, it should be started manually after the
package upgrade by running :program:`/opt/thinlinc/sbin/tl-setup`.

.. _upgrade_migration:

Configuration migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the package has been upgraded, a decision will sometimes be
required regarding how to migrate the configuration. When a conflict
between the saved configuration and the configuration in the new release
arises, a choice has to be made.

ThinLinc setup will present choices regarding migration of Hiveconf
files. Conflicting files that aren't Hiveconf files are not affected by
ThinLinc setup. In these cases the package upgrade will have kept your
configuration in place and saved the new default values from the new
ThinLinc version as :file:`.rpmnew` or :file:`.dpkg-dist` versions of
the conflicting files. Potential migration of non-Hiveconf files has to
be done manually.

The three options that are presented in ThinLinc setup are as follows:

-  Use the new Hiveconf files and migrate the parameters and values from
   the old files.

   With this option, all configuration changes done in the earlier
   version are preserved. The configuration will be based on the new
   files. Values of parameters that have been moved or renamed in the
   new release will be migrated to the new parameters. Parameters that
   have been removed will be deleted. Comments will not be migrated. The
   file structure and file names may also be different. All parameters
   and values from the listed Hiveconf files are copied over. This means
   that unchanged parameters in these files will use the default values
   from the earlier release.

   Note that a certain parameter will be defined if it is defined either
   in the new or old Hiveconf files. This means that if you have removed
   some parameters, for example one of the example profiles, those
   parameters will again exist after the migration. For profiles,
   however, this will not affect the user session, since profiles are
   only visible if they are also listed in the "order" parameter.

   Parameters will be removed from the new Hiveconf files if they are
   defined elsewhere. For example,
   if :servconf:`/vsmagent/agent_hostname` has been moved from
   :file:`vsmagent.hconf` to :file:`local.hconf`, this change
   will be preserved.

-  Use all old Hiveconf files.

   With this option, all the old files are used. Custom comments and the
   file structure are preserved, but no new parameters or comments from
   the new release are introduced. Please note that configuration files
   which are identical in the old and new release are not listed or
   processed. This means that new default values in such files are
   introduced even with this option.

-  Ignore old Hiveconf files and use the new files.

   With this option, the listed configuration files are ignored and the
   new files are used instead. Please note that configuration files
   which are identical in the old and new release are not listed or
   processed. This means that configuration changes to such files are
   preserved even with this option.
