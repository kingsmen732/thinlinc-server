                 symbolic link to activate the ThinLinc desktop
                 customizer (TLDC) during session startup, allowing
                 tailored desktop environments for users.

Enabling the custom desktops for users
--------------------------------------

Enabling the Custom Desktops for users is easy. Simply create a symbolic
link in :file:`/opt/thinlinc/etc/xstartup.d`:

.. code:: console

   $ sudo ln -s /opt/thinlinc/bin/tl-desktop-activate.sh
      /opt/thinlinc/etc/xstartup.d/35-tl-desktop-activate.sh

The ThinLinc session startup will read this file and write a
:file:`~/.config/menus/applications.menu` (and possibly create symbolic
links under :file:`~/.kde/share/apps/kdesktop/Desktop` if you're using
KDE).

.. note::

   The TLDC activation script only runs TLDC for non-root users. Test
   your TLDC configuration using a normal user.
