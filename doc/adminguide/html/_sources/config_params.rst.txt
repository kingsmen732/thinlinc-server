   :description: Explore the configuration parameters for ThinLinc
                 servers, covering profiles, session startup, shadowing,
                 web access, master, agent, subclusters, and various
                 utilities.

Server configuration parameters
-------------------------------

The ThinLinc server is configured using a number of configuration
parameters stored in Hiveconf. For information about how to access and
set the parameters, please refer to :ref:`hiveconf`. In this chapter, we
will describe the different parameters and their meaning.

The parameters used in ThinLinc are divided into a number of folders,
each having zero or more subfolders. The following folders exist:

-  :servconf:`/profiles` contains parameters for configuring the
   different session profiles. This folder normally resides in
   :file:`/opt/thinlinc/etc/conf.d/profiles.hconf`.

-  :servconf:`/sessionstart` contains some parameters used during
   session startup. This folder normally resides in
   :file:`/opt/thinlinc/etc/conf.d/sessionstart.hconf`.

-  :servconf:`/shadowing` contains parameters used to control access to
   the shadowing feature. This folder normally resides in
   :file:`/opt/thinlinc/etc/conf.d/shadowing.hconf`.

-  :servconf:`/tlwebadm` contains parameters for the tlwebadm web
   configuration interface. This folder normally resides in
   :file:`/opt/thinlinc/etc/conf.d/tlwebadm.hconf`.

-  :servconf:`/utils` contains parameters used by miscellaneous
   ThinLinc utilities. Each utility has its own configuration file, but
   all parameters are then merged in under :servconf:`/utils` when read
   by the Hiveconf framework.

-  :servconf:`/vsm` contains parameters common to both the VSM agent
   and the VSM server. This folder normally resides in
   :file:`/opt/thinlinc/etc/conf.d/vsm.hconf`.

-  :servconf:`/vsmagent` contains parameters specific to the VSM agent.
   This folder normally resides in
   :file:`/opt/thinlinc/etc/conf.d/vsmagent.hconf`.

-  :servconf:`/vsmserver` contains parameters specific to the VSM
   server. This folder normally resides in
   :file:`/opt/thinlinc/etc/conf.d/vsmserver.hconf`.

-  :servconf:`/vsmserver/subclusters` contains definitions of
   subclusters within the ThinLinc cluster. This folder normally resides
   in :file:`/opt/thinlinc/etc/conf.d/vsmserver.hconf`.

-  :servconf:`/webaccess` contains parameters for the server part of
   ThinLinc Web Access. This folder normally resides in
   :file:`/opt/thinlinc/etc/conf.d/webaccess.hconf`.
