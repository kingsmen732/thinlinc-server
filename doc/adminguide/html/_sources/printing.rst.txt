                 including local printer support, nearest printer, and
                 printer access control, all integrated with the CUPS
                 system to enhance user flexibility and simplify
                 administration.

Printer features
================

ThinLinc has several printer-related features that aim to provide the
user with maximum flexibility while making the administrator's work
easier. A ThinLinc system normally uses CUPS (Common Unix Printing
System) to provide normal printing services. By integrating with CUPS,
ThinLinc also provides the following features:

-  **Local printer support** allows users to print documents on a
   printer that is connected to their terminal from applications running
   on the ThinLinc server.

   See :ref:`thinlocal` for documentation on this feature.

-  **Nearest printer** is a feature that simplifies the printing process
   for the user by automatically printing to a printer that is located
   at the terminal the user is currently using. Users only need to know
   that they should always print to the **nearest** printer --- the
   system will figure out the rest based on a database of terminals,
   printers and locations, eliminating the need to learn the names of
   printers at different locations. This decreases the need for support.

   See :ref:`nearestprinter` for documentation on this feature.

-  **Printer access control** uses the same database of terminals,
   locations and printers as the Nearest Printer feature to dynamically
   limit which printers a user may print to based on the terminal the
   user is currently using. This feature also limits the list of
   printers seen by each user to the printers the user is allowed to
   use, simplifying choice of printer for the user by only showing the
   printers that are relevant at the current location.

   See :ref:`printeraccesscontrol` for documentation on this
   feature.
