The system health module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The System Health module allows you to check the running state of the
ThinLinc master, agent and Web Access services. There is also a tool to
perform a user or group lookup which reports the time for the lookup.

-  :guilabel:`Service status` reports the current running state of the
   master (**vsmserver.service**), agent (**vsmagent.service**), and Web
   Access (**tlwebaccess.service**) services.

-  :guilabel:`Users and group lookup` allows you to test the performance
   of user and group lookup on the system.

   Fill in values for username and/or group and click the
   :guilabel:`Test user and group lookup` button to perform a lookup.
