   :description: Overview of the configuration parameters for the
                 ThinLinc agent service, including settings for session
                 management, network configuration, and environment
                 customization.

.. _configuration_vsmagent:

.. server-config-folder:: /vsmagent

Parameters in /vsmagent/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section, we will describe all the parameters currently used by
the VSM agent. These configuration parameters reside in
:file:`/opt/thinlinc/etc/conf.d/vsmagent.hconf`.

.. server-config:: /vsmagent/agent_hostname

   Public hostname; the hostname that clients are redirected to. If not
   defined, the agent will use the computer's IP address. This is the
   default configuration, and means that ThinLinc does not require DNS
   to work properly. However, if you are using Network Address
   Translation (NAT), you must set this parameter to an IP address or
   DNS name that all clients can connect to. For example:

   .. code:: ini

      agent_hostname = thinlinc.example.com

.. server-config:: /vsmagent/allowed_clients

   This is the space-separated list of VSM servers that should be
   allowed to connect to this VSM agent and create new sessions.
   ``localhost`` is always allowed, as well as the IP of the hostname
   the VSM agent runs on and the host specified in the
   :servconf:`/vsmagent/master_hostname` parameter.

.. server-config:: /vsmagent/default_environment

   This subfolder of :servconf:`/vsmagent` contains environment
   variables that should be set in each user's session. Example:

   .. code:: ini

      [/vsmagent/default_environment]
      TOWN=Springfield
      LC_CTYPE=sv_SE.UTF-8
      FOOBAR=foobar

   This will set the :environ:`TOWN` environment variable to
   ``Springfield`` , the :environ:`LC_CTYPE` variable to ``sv_SE.UTF-8``
   and the :environ:`FOOBAR` variable to ``foobar`` in each user's
   session.

   .. note::

      :program:`xsession` is executed via a login shell, which may
      modify the environment and override values in
      :servconf:`/vsmagent/default_environment`.

.. server-config:: /vsmagent/default_geometry

   The default session size, to be used when clients are not requesting
   any specific session size.

.. server-config:: /vsmagent/display_max

   The maximum display number to be used for ThinLinc sessions on each
   specific VSM agent host. Default value is ``2000``.

   The maximum ThinLinc sessions allowed on a specific VSM Agent host is
   :servconf:`/vsmagent/display_max` -
   :servconf:`/vsmagent/display_min`.

.. server-config:: /vsmagent/display_min

   The lowest display numbers to use for clients. The default is ``10``,
   and unless there are other processes needing display numbers, the
   recommendation is not to change this number. See :ref:`tcp-ports` for
   an in-depth explanation of port allocation.

.. server-config:: /vsmagent/listen_port

   The TCP port VSM Agent listen to for incoming requests. This should
   normally be set to the same value as :servconf:`/vsm/vsm_agent_port`.

.. server-config:: /vsmagent/lowest_user_port

   The lowest port to be used by normal user processes. This may *never*
   be lower than :servconf:`/vsmagent/max_session_port`. See
   :ref:`tcp-ports` for an in-depth explanation of port allocation.

.. server-config:: /vsmagent/make_homedir

   If this parameter is true, the user's home directory will be
   automatically created if it doesn't exist.

.. server-config:: /vsmagent/make_homedir_mode

   When a home directory is created (see parameter
   :servconf:`/vsmagent/make_homedir` above), the mode for the newly
   created directory will be determined by this parameter.

.. server-config:: /vsmagent/master_hostname

   This parameter specifies the hostname of the master machine, i.e. the
   machine that runs the VSM server. In a HA setup, this should be the
   hostname of the IP address that is on the machine that is currently
   the active node, to ensure that services on the agents that need to
   access the VSM Server always connects to the machine that is up and
   running.

.. server-config:: /vsmagent/max_session_port

   The highest port to use for VNC and tunnel ports on the VSM Agent.
   See :ref:`tcp-ports` for an in-depth explanation of port allocation.

.. server-config:: /vsmagent/single_signon

   This parameter decides whether the passwords of the users should be
   saved in order to support Single Sign-On when connecting to servers
   from the ThinLinc session, for example when running a Windows
   session.

.. server-config:: /vsmagent/xserver_args

   Extra arguments to pass on to the X server Xvnc. One common case is
   to use :option:`-localhost` , which makes Xvnc require connections to
   originate from localhost, thus forcing applications to either be
   local or use a tunnel (which often also means that the traffic is
   encrypted). Other examples include :option:`-IdleTimeout` and
   :option:`-MaxIdleTime`. For more information, see
   :ref:`configuration_limiting_lifetime`.

.. server-config:: /vsmagent/xauthority_location

   This parameter controls the location of the :file:`Xauthority` file.
   Currently, two values are supported: With ``homedir``, the file will
   be placed in the user's home directory. With ``sessiondir``, the file
   will be placed in the session directory below
   :file:`/var/opt/thinlinc/sessions`. The :environ:`XAUTHORITY`
   environment variable is set accordingly by the VSM agent.
