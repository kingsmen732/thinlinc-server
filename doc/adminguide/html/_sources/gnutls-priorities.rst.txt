   :description: Explains how ThinLinc administrators can configure
                 algorithm availability and order using GnuTLS priority
                 strings for services that use tlstunnel.

GnuTLS priority strings
=======================

ThinLinc uses priority strings to allow the administrator to select
their own preferred availability and order of algorithms used by GnuTLS
for services that use tlstunnel. The priority string is a
colon-delimited list of strings being either keywords (groups of
algorithms) or algorithms which can be individually enabled or disabled.

For more information, see the GnuTLS documentation about priority
strings.
