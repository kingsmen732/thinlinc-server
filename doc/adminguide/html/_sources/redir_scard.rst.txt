Using smart card redirection
----------------------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using ThinLinc, it is possible to access the locally connected smart
cards and smart card readers from the ThinLinc session. This means that
you can use smart cards for encrypting your email, signing documents and
authenticating against remote systems.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The application which communicates with the smart card must be using
   the PC/SC API and be dynamically linked to pcsc-lite.

Enabling smart card redirection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Smart card redirection is always activated on the server so there is no
administration required to enable it.

Limitations and additional information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  When a client disconnects, all smart cards and smart card readers
   will disappear for the applications. Some applications do not handle
   hot-plug and must therefore be restarted when this happens.
