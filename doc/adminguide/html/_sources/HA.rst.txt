   :description: Learn how to configure ThinLinc with High Availability
                 (HA) to protect the master from single points of
                 failure, ensuring continuous service and session
                 database synchronization across multiple servers.

High availability
=================

This chapter describes how to set up ThinLinc with High Availability
(from now on referred to as "HA") for the VSM server. Since the VSM
server service handles load-balancing and the session database, it can
be problematic if the machine fails. ThinLinc HA provides protection for
this service against the single point of failure that the hardware
running the VSM server normally is.

The basic principle behind this setup is to have two equal machines,
both capable of running VSM server. If one of the machines goes down for
some reason, the other machine will take over and serve VSM server
requests with no or short interruption of service.

.. note::

   The HA functionality provided by ThinLinc provides synchronization of
   the ThinLinc session database across two VSM servers. The software
   used by these machines to implement failover is not part of ThinLinc,
   and must be installed and configured according to your requirements.
   The industry standard for doing so on Linux is provided by Pacemaker
   and Corosync, see https://clusterlabs.org for more information.
