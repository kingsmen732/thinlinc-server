   :description: Overview of key configuration parameters shared by the
                 master and agent services, covering settings related to
                 tunnel management, VNC communication, and master-agent
                 interaction in ThinLinc.

.. _configuration_vsm:

.. server-config-folder:: /vsm

Parameters in /vsm/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameters in the :servconf:`/vsm` folder are used by both the VSM agent
and the VSM server. Neither of them need to be changed on a normal
ThinLinc installation. These configuration parameters reside in
:file:`/opt/thinlinc/etc/conf.d/vsm.hconf`.

.. server-config:: /vsm/tunnel_bind_base

   The tunnels set up by the client to access various resources (audio,
   serial port, network resources, local printer) need one port number
   each on the server running the VSM agent the client is connected to.
   This parameter decides the lowest such port that is allocated by the
   VSM agent. Each user has a port range defined by the formula:

      :servconf:`/vsm/tunnel_bind_base` + *display* Ã— 10 +
      *service_slot*

   where the *service_slot* depends on which service will use the
   tunnel. This port range is however used only for sessions with
   display numbers less than 100. See :ref:`tcp-ports` for an in-depth
   explanation of port allocation.

   .. note::

      This parameter should normally not be changed.

.. server-config:: /vsm/tunnelservices

   There are several parameters under the
   :servconf:`/vsm/tunnelservices` folder. Each one decides which ports
   are used as server-side termination points for the tunnels used to
   access client resources. See :ref:`tcp-ports` for an in-depth
   explanation of port allocation.

   .. note::

      None of these parameters should normally be changed.

.. server-config:: /vsm/tunnelslots_per_session

   The number of ports to reserve for tunnel port endpoints on the
   server. The number of ports actually used depends on the number of
   services defined under :servconf:`/vsm/tunnelservices` . We recommend
   letting this parameter have its default value (10), since that
   provides a margin for future services. See :ref:`tcp-ports` for an
   in-depth explanation of port allocation.

   .. note::

      This parameter should normally not be changed and must not be
      changed whilst there are any running sessions.

.. server-config:: /vsm/vnc_port_base

   The port base for VNC communication. The VNC protocol runs on one
   port per active user on the VSM agent host, and this is the base of
   the numbers used. That is, for the first user, the port will be
   :servconf:`/vsm/vnc_port_base` + 1, for the second user
   :servconf:`/vsm/vnc_port_base` + 2 and so on. This algorithm is used
   only for display numbers below 100. See :ref:`tcp-ports` for an
   in-depth explanation of port allocation.

   .. note::

      This parameter should normally not be changed.

.. server-config:: /vsm/vsm_agent_port

   VSM agent communication. This is the port that the VSM server
   connects to on VSM Agents. This traffic is not encrypted.

   .. note::

      This parameter should normally not be changed

.. server-config:: /vsm/vsm_server_port

   The port that the VSM server listens to.

   .. note::

      This parameter should normally not be changed
