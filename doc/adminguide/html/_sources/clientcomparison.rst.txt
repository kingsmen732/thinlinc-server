   :description: Overview of the ThinLinc native client and Web Access
                 client, comparing their features and platform support
                 to help administrators and users select the appropriate
                 client for connecting to ThinLinc servers.

Choosing a client
=================

There are two separate clients that can be used to connect to your
ThinLinc server or cluster: :ref:`client` and the web client
:ref:`tlwebaccess`. In this chapter, we cover the differences between
the two.

.. note::

   As an administrator, you have the option to let your users choose
   which client to use, or only allow access to your ThinLinc server or
   cluster using one of them.

Compared to Web Access, the native ThinLinc client offers a wider range
of features, including full-screen over multiple monitors, sound
redirection, and access to client-side hardware such as printers and
smart card readers. It is also capable of providing server-side access
to your client-side file system. It supports authentication using
passwords, public keys, smart cards, one-time passwords, and
Kerberos. The native client is available on all major desktop and thin
client operating systems. See :ref:`clientplatforms` for a list of all
supported platforms.

On the other hand, Web Access offers the flexibility of being available
on all platforms with a modern web browser, including mobile devices. It
supports authentication using passwords and one-time passwords.
