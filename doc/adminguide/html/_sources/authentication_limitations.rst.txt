   :description: Summary of authentication limitations in ThinLinc, with
                 a focus on case sensitivity and configuration
                 requirements for SSH servers.

Limitations
-----------

Some PAM modules and authentication mechanisms are case-sensitive, while
others are not. Usernames in the ThinLinc client are case-sensitive by
default, however this behavior can be changed. See
:clientconf:`LOWERCASE_LOGIN_NAME` in :ref:`clientconf_params` for
details.

The SSH server should be configured to allow "keyboard-interactive"
authentication for full functionality. The "password" authentication
method does not allow multiple interactive prompts, which are required
for things such as password changes during login.
