Description of local devices tab settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here follows a detailed description of the settings available in the
local devices tab.

:guilabel:`Export --- Sound`
   When enabled, sound will be sent from the ThinLinc server to your
   local client. A small local sound daemon will be started by the
   client, which connects to a secure tunnel to the server. See
   :ref:`sound-redirection` for more information about this
   topic.

      Sound system selection interface

   On Linux there is a :guilabel:`Details...` button next to the
   :guilabel:`Sound` check box that will allow you to choose between
   PulseAudio, ALSA and OSS for the local sound system. You can also let
   the ThinLinc client select the correct system automatically.

:guilabel:`Export --- Serial ports`
   It is possible to forward two serial ports from the client to make it
   available to programs you run on the server. To select which of your
   local serial devices to export you can press the
   :guilabel:`Details...` button next to the :guilabel:`Serial port`
   check box. This will bring up a dialog where you can select which two
   serial ports should be exported.

      Serial port selection interface

   The :guilabel:`Device` should be a path to a Linux serial device
   (such as :file:`/dev/ttyS0`) or a Windows COM port name (such as
   ``COM1``). Enter the device to export in the text field or press the
   :guilabel:`...` button to browse to the wanted device.

:guilabel:`Export --- Drives`
   This check box turns on export of local devices from your terminal
   top the ThinLinc server. This makes your local drives available from
   your ThinLinc session. To select which drives to export you press the
   :guilabel:`Details...` button next to :guilabel:`Drives` check box.
   That presents a dialog where you can build a list of drives to export
   and set export permissions.

      Local drive export selection interface

   The :guilabel:`Export local drives` window consists of two parts. At
   the top there is a list containing exported paths, with two control
   buttons below. The lower half contains settings fields for the
   currently selected path. When you select a path listed in the upper
   list you will see its corresponding settings in the drive options
   field below. You can then change the selected path by changing the
   values on the options field.

   To add a new path to the list you press the :guilabel:`Add` button.
   That creates a new empty land in the path list. The new path will be
   automatically selected. You can then modify the settings in the lower
   half. Set the path and export permission for the new export. To set
   the export path you can either write it manually in the path text
   field or press the :guilabel:`...` button to bring up a file
   navigation window.

   To remove a path you simply select a path and press the
   :guilabel:`Remove` button.

   The Windows client features a mechanism that makes it easy to export
   the :file:`My Documents` folder. This feature is activated by
   pressing the :guilabel:`My Documents` button. Regardless of the local
   folder name, this folder will be mounted as :file:`MyDocuments` on
   the server.

   The export permissions can be one of the following three options,
   :guilabel:`Not exported`, :guilabel:`Read only` and :guilabel:`Read
   and write`. The :guilabel:`Not exported` option can be used to
   temporarily turn off an export without having to delete it. The
   :guilabel:`Read only` option means that you from the ThinLinc session
   will be able to read from the export, but not write. The
   :guilabel:`Read and write` option means that you from the ThinLinc
   session will be able to both read and write.

:guilabel:`Export --- Printer`
   By checking this check box the client will export your local printer
   to make it available from the ThinLinc session. For more information
   about this feature, see :ref:`client_export_printer` and
   :ref:`thinlocal`.

      Printer options dialogue

   On Windows and macOS there is a :guilabel:`Details...` button next to
   the :guilabel:`Printer` check box that will allow you to select if
   the print job should be sent to the default printer or if the printer
   selection dialog should be used on every print.

:guilabel:`Export --- Smart card readers`
   This check box makes all local smart card readers and smart cards
   available to applications on the ThinLinc server. It is not necessary
   to check this box to authenticate using smart cards, but it is needed
   if you also wish to authenticate using smart cards to a Windows
   Remote Desktop Server.
