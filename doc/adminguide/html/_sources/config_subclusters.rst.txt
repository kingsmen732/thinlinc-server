   :description: Configuration parameters for defining subclusters in
                 ThinLinc, including agent assignments, user
                 associations, and group associations.

.. _configuration_subcluster_params:

.. server-config-folder:: /vsmserver/subclusters

Parameters in /vsmserver/subclusters/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section, we will describe all the parameters used for defining
subclusters. For more information about subclusters see
:ref:`configuration_subcluster`. These configuration parameters reside
in :file:`/opt/thinlinc/etc/conf.d/vsmserver.hconf`.

.. server-config:: /vsmserver/subclusters/<name>/agents

   All ThinLinc agents part of this ThinLinc subcluster. New user
   sessions for this subcluster are created on the agents in this list.
   Agents later removed from the list will continue to function normally
   for existing sessions until those sessions end. This should be a
   space-separated list of DNS host names. These will be used for
   communication between the master and the agent. The name reported to
   the client is fetched from the agent itself; names in
   :servconf:`/vsmserver/subclusters/<name>/agents` are not reported
   directly to the clients.

.. server-config:: /vsmserver/subclusters/<name>/users

   All users who should be associated with this specific ThinLinc
   subcluster. This should be a space-separated list of usernames. If
   both :servconf:`/vsmserver/subclusters/<name>/users` and
   :servconf:`/vsmserver/subclusters/<name>/groups` are empty it means
   the subcluster is a default subcluster.

.. server-config:: /vsmserver/subclusters/<name>/groups

   All user groups that should be associated with this specific ThinLinc
   subcluster. This should be a space-separated list of group names. If
   both :servconf:`/vsmserver/subclusters/<name>/groups` and
   :servconf:`/vsmserver/subclusters/<name>/users` are empty it means
   the subcluster is a default subcluster.

.. server-config:: /vsmserver/subclusters/<name>/max_users_per_agent

   Maximum concurrent users allowed per agent within the subcluster. The
   default value is 0, which implies an unlimited number of users. When the
   limit is reached, the agent will no longer be considered by the load
   balancer for new users.
