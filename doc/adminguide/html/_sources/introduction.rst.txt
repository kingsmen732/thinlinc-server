   :description: Introduction to ThinLinc, a remote desktop terminal
                 server solution for Linux. This guide provides an
                 overview of ThinLinc's architecture, installation,
                 administration, and available clients, along with
                 additional resources for further information.

Introduction
============

ThinLinc is a software that provides remote Linux desktop access by
combining proprietary code with open-source projects like TigerVNC,
noVNC and OpenSSH. The core purpose of the software is to securely grant
graphical access to Linux machines. The ThinLinc software also works
closely with the existing Linux system to utilize it's already well
established ecosystem.

Our hope is that ThinLinc will help make Linux more accessible for
people in their everyday lives.
