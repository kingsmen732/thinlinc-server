Description of display tab settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here follows a detailed description of the settings available in the
display tab.

:guilabel:`Windowed`
   This option makes the ThinLinc session appear as a normal window on
   the desktop that can be moved and resized.

:guilabel:`Full screen on current monitor`
   This option makes the ThinLinc session cover the entire screen area
   of the monitor that the client is current on. If you run in
   full-screen mode and want to reach the native session that is hidden
   by the ThinLinc session then you can switch out from full-screen
   mode. To do this you press the key assigned to bring up the session
   pop-up menu. Normally this menu is bound to the :kbd:`F8` key, but
   can be manually changed. See the :guilabel:`Popup menu key` setting
   on the :guilabel:`Options` tab above for more information on this. In
   the session menu you should select :guilabel:`Full screen` to toggle
   full-screen mode.

:guilabel:`Full screen on all monitors`
   This option makes the ThinLinc session cover the entire screen area
   of all the monitors that are connected to the local client. Leaving
   full-screen mode to access the native session is done the same way
   as for full screen on the current monitor.

:guilabel:`Full screen on selected monitor(s)`
   This option makes the ThinLinc session cover the entire screen area
   of the monitors that have been selected in the monitor selection box
   below this option. Leaving full-screen mode to access the native
   session is done the same way as for the other full-screen modes.

   More monitors may be included than have been selected in the
   selection box in order to create a rectangular session size. These
   extra monitors will be indicated with a checkered pattern.
