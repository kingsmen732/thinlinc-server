   :description: Guide to using the Status module in ThinLinc's web
                 administration interface for monitoring licenses,
                 server load, and managing sessions.

.. _tlwebadm_status:

The status module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The status module allows you to view or manipulate the following aspects
of ThinLinc, by selecting the relevant submenu:

-  :guilabel:`Licenses` allows you to view license usage.

-  :guilabel:`Load` allows you to check the current workload on the
   ThinLinc agents.

-  :guilabel:`Sessions` allows you to terminate, shadow or view details
   of sessions.

.. _tlwebadm_licenses:

Licenses
^^^^^^^^

The licenses menu provides graphs showing current and historical license
usage, along with the current total number of licenses. It also includes
functionality to generate a graph displaying license usage over a
specified number of days in the past.

.. _tlwebadm_load:

Load
^^^^

The load menu displays information about system utilization across the
ThinLinc agents, enabling administrators to monitor performance metrics
and evaluate the capacity for adding more users to the cluster.

The overview shows the current workload for each agent in the ThinLinc
cluster, including the total number of users (not only users running
ThinLinc sessions), memory usage, CPU usage, and rating. To view load
details for a specific agent, click on the agent's name. A popup will
appear with detailed information about the selected session. Refer to
the list below for explanation of the rating and other load parameters.

-  :guilabel:`ThinLinc users`: The number of users on the agent running
   one or more ThinLinc sessions.

-  :guilabel:`Total number of users`: The total numbers of unique users
   on the agent (not only users running ThinLinc sessions). This
   includes both human users as well as system users for background
   processes.

-  :guilabel:`Memory (used RAM+swap)`: The combined total of RAM and
   swap memory currently in use.

-  :guilabel:`RAM (used/total)`: The amount of RAM currently used
   compared to the total available RAM.

-  :guilabel:`Swap (used/total)`: The amount of swap memory currently
   used compared to the total available swap memory.

-  :guilabel:`CPU`: The total CPU resources being utilized across all
   available CPUs.

-  :guilabel:`Load (1 min)`: The CPU load 1-minute average.

-  :guilabel:`Number of CPUs`: The total number of available CPUs.

-  :guilabel:`Bogomips`: A measurement of the system's computational
   capacity, providing an estimate of processing performance.

-  :guilabel:`Rating`: A score indicating the agentâ€™s capacity to
   handle additional sessions; for example, a rating of 10.0 suggests
   that the agent can accommodate approximately 10 more sessions.

-  :guilabel:`Penalty points`: Points assigned to the agent for
   performance issues, such as slow response times or additional users
   connecting. These points negatively impact the agent's rating.

-  :guilabel:`Last updated`: The timestamp indicating when the load
   information was last refreshed.

.. _tlwebadm_sessions:

Sessions
^^^^^^^^

When you select the sessions menu, a table with all currently active
sessions is displayed. To perform additional tasks, click on the
corresponding username. This will bring up the session details popup,
which displays all the session parameters for the chosen session. The
information table in the popup is described below.

-  :guilabel:`Created`: A timestamp for when the session was initially
   created.

-  :guilabel:`Session status`: The health status of the session as seen
   by the master machine.

-  :guilabel:`Connection status`: The current connection status between
   the client and the session.

-  :guilabel:`Last connection`: A timestamp for when the last connection
   was initiated and the IP address of the last connected client.

-  :guilabel:`Agent`: The DNS host name of the server that is hosting
   the session, as seen by the master machine.

-  :guilabel:`Agent server address`: The DNS host name of the server
   that is hosting this session, as seen by the client machine.

-  :guilabel:`Display number`: Each session on a certain server has a
   unique number, the X Window System display number. Display zero is
   reserved, and never used for ThinLinc sessions.

-  :guilabel:`Terminal ID`: An identification of the thin terminal. This
   is the terminal's hardware address (MAC address).

-  :guilabel:`Framebuffer size`: The size (resolution) of the active
   session.

-  :guilabel:`Local screen size`: The size (resolution) of the
   terminal's screen.

-  :guilabel:`Session process ID`: The PID (process identification
   number) of the :program:`tl-session` process, which is the parent for
   all processes belonging to a certain session.

-  :guilabel:`Command`: The command line that was specified when
   starting this session. This is usually empty for full desktop
   sessions.

Below the session information table, there are two buttons:

-  :guilabel:`Terminate session`: By clicking this button, you can
   terminate a session immediately. Caution: This can lead to data loss,
   since applications running on the ThinLinc servers may not hold
   unsaved data.

-  :guilabel:`Shadow session`: This button will generate a ThinLinc
   "launch file" (see :ref:`clientplatforms_web_integration`) that
   starts the native ThinLinc client, preconfigured to shadow the
   current user.

   .. note::

      The user might not be informed that shadowing is in progress if
      shadowing notification has been disabled. See :ref:`shadowing` for
      details.
