   :description: Learn how to set up and configure a ThinLinc cluster
                 with multiple agent servers for session load balancing,
                 redundancy, and scalability.

.. _install_cluster:

Cluster installation
--------------------

In this section, we will describe how to add agent servers to form a
ThinLinc cluster; allowing session load balancing and redundancy.

.. note::

   This section does *not* address configuration of high
   availability. For information on configuring your ThinLinc cluster
   for high availability, see :ref:`HA`.

A ThinLinc cluster consists of one master server (or two master servers
in a :ref:`high availability configuration <ha>`) with multiple agent
servers. While ThinLinc in its simplest configuration may be run with
both the master and agent installed on the same machine, running
ThinLinc in a cluster configuration conveys numerous advantages:

1. A cluster configuration allows load balancing of sessions across
   multiple agents

2. Having multiple agents offers redundancy; for example, if one agent
   goes down or is taken out of service for maintenance, other agents
   are still available to handle user sessions

3. A cluster configuration is scalable. Since most of the workload is
   taken up by the agents and not the master, adding more capacity to
   your ThinLinc installation is generally as easy as installing one or
   more new agent servers

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This chapter assumes you already have a ThinLinc master server running,
installed according to :ref:`install_install`. It also assumes you can
authenticate using the same system credentials on all nodes in the
ThinLinc cluster.

.. _install_cluster_agent:

New agent configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Firstly, ThinLinc needs to be installed and configured on the new node
that is to be part of the agent pool:

.. note::

   It is recommended that all agent nodes in the cluster are kept
   consistent in terms of configuration and software installed. This way
   the user gets the same experience regardless of agent node.

   Similarly, keeping user home directories on a central file server is
   recommended for a consistent experience over all agent nodes.

1. Install ThinLinc on the new agent node according to
   :ref:`install_install`. Select :guilabel:`Agent` when asked for the
   type of ThinLinc server to configure.

2. Set :servconf:`/vsmagent/master_hostname` to the domain name or IP of
   the pre-existing machine running the master service (**vsmserver**),
   for example:

   .. code:: console

      $ sudo tl-config /vsmagent/master_hostname=master.example.com

3. For the browser client :ref:`Web Access<tlwebaccess>` to work as
   intended, set :servconf:`/webaccess/login_page` to the URL of the Web
   Access login page on the master server, for example:

   .. code:: console

      $ sudo tl-config /webaccess/login_page=https://master.example.com:300/

4. Restart the agent and Web Access service (**vsmagent** and
   **tlwebaccess**) on the new agent node:

   .. code:: console

      $ sudo systemctl restart vsmagent tlwebaccess

.. _install_cluster_master:

Master configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The machine running the master service then need to be made aware of the
agent node configured in the last step:

1. Add the newly created agent to |agents| of the subcluster where the
   extra capacity is needed. If you are not using the :ref:`subcluster
   features<configuration_subcluster>` of ThinLinc, add it to the
   **Default** subcluster:

   .. code:: console

      $ # Get the current list of agents in the Default subcluster
      $ tl-config /vsmserver/subclusters/Default/agents
      127.0.0.1
      $ # Add the new agent (new-agent.example.com) to the agent list
      $ sudo tl-config /vsmserver/subclusters/Default/agents=\
      "127.0.0.1 new-agent.example.com"

2. Restart the master service:

   .. code:: console

      $ sudo systemctl restart vsmserver

.. |agents| replace::
   :servconf:`/vsmserver/subclusters/<name>/agents`

Your new agent node is now ready to accept new sessions. For further
information about further configuring and maintaining your ThinLinc
cluster, see :ref:`configuration_cluster`.
