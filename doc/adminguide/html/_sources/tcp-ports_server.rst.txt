   :description: Overview of TCP ports required for ThinLinc's master
                 server operation, including SSH, Web Access,
                 administration, and communication between components.

.. _tcp-ports_vsmserver:

On a machine running VSM Server
-------------------------------

22: SSH Daemon
   Port 22 is not used by ThinLinc *per se*, but since no ThinLinc
   installation can work without a running SSH daemon, we list port 22
   here. Port 22 is the normal SSH port, but basically any port can be
   used --- the client has support for connecting to any port. Note
   however that if the SSH daemon on the VSM server is listening on port
   **x**, all VSM agents must also have their SSH daemons configured to
   listen on port **x**.

300: ThinLinc Web Access
   By default, ThinLinc's Web Access service tlwebaccess is available on
   TCP port 300. Traffic to this port is encrypted (TLS).

   .. note::

      The port on which tlwebaccess runs is configurable via the
      parameter :servconf:`/webaccess/listen_port`. See
      :ref:`configuration_tlwebaccess` for details.

1010: ThinLinc Administration Interface (tlwebadm)
   By default, ThinLinc's web-based administration interface is
   available on TCP port 1010. In order to access this interface
   remotely, port 1010 will need to be reachable. Traffic to this port
   is encrypted (TLS).

   .. note::

      The port on which tlwebadm runs is configurable via the parameter
      :servconf:`/tlwebadm/listen_port`. See
      :ref:`configuration_tlwebadm` for details.

9000: VSM server
   The VSM server listens on port 9000. The traffic is not encrypted,
   but sensitive information will only be shared with root or
   connections originating from a port lower than 1024, from a list of
   known IP addresses. The protocol used is XML-RPC through HTTP (using
   a minimal internal HTTP server in the VSM server).
