Using serial port redirection
-----------------------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using ThinLinc, it is possible to access the serial ports of the client
from the ThinLinc session. This means that you can utilize peripheral
devices which connect through a serial port, such as digital cameras,
PDAs and modems. Up to two serial ports are supported at a time.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The application which communicates with the serial port must be
   dynamically linked. Statically linked applications are not supported.

Enabling serial port redirection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Serial port redirection is activated (for the current user session) by
sourcing the file :program:`tl-serial-redir.sh`. It can be done manually
with this command:

.. code:: console

   $ source /opt/thinlinc/libexec/tl-serial-redir.sh

It is necessary to source this file because it sets the environment
variables :environ:`CYCLADE_DEVICES` and :environ:`LD_PRELOAD`. Thus,
all applications needing serial port access should be started as a
subprocess to this shell. The easiest way to accomplish this is to
source :program:`tl-serial-redir.sh` from the session startup scripts.
To automatically activate serial port redirection at login for all
users, execute this command:

.. code:: console

   $ sudo ln -s /opt/thinlinc/libexec/tl-serial-redir.sh \
      /opt/thinlinc/etc/xstartup.d/42-tl-serial-redir.sh

Accessing the redirected port from applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using redirected serial ports, applications should be configured to
use a special, personal device-file, instead of a port such as
:file:`/dev/ttyS0`. The two device files are called
:file:`$TLSESSIONDATA/dev/ttyS0` and :file:`$TLSESSIONDATA/dev/ttyS1`.

.. tip::

   Since the session number varies, it's often convenient to use the
   symbolic link :file:`/var/opt/thinlinc/sessions/$USER/last`, which
   points to the last started session directory. For example, the first
   serial port can be accessed as
   :file:`/var/opt/thinlinc/sessions/$USER/last/dev/ttyS0`.

Limitations and additional information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  When reconnecting to an existing session, it might take up to 10
   seconds before the serial ports are available.

-  A maximum of two serial ports per session can be redirected.

-  The redirection is handled by processes called
   :program:`cyclades-ser-cli`. It writes debugging information to
   :file:`$TLSESSIONDATA/ttyS0.log` and
   :file:`$TLSESSIONDATA/ttyS1.log`. These processes will automatically
   terminate when the session terminates.

-  Applications that uses the ``ioctl`` ``TIOCMGET`` are not supported
   yet.
