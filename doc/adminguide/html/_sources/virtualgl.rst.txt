Overview
~~~~~~~~

VirtualGL is used to provide server-side hardware 3D acceleration to
applications displayed on a remote client. VirtualGL can be used with
ThinLinc to provide accelerated graphics for OpenGL applications running
in a Linux environment.

Although ThinLinc is designed to work in combination with VirtualGL,
VirtualGL is not developed or maintained directly by Cendio AB, and as
such is not shipped as a part of the ThinLinc product.

Installation and configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Full documentation regarding the installation and configuration of
VirtualGL can be found online at
https://virtualgl.org/Documentation/Documentation.

.. note::

   The following section numbers references the VirtualGL 2.3.3
   documentation. Documentation for past or future VirtualGL releases
   may have different section numbers.

For the general case, it should be sufficient to consult the following
sections:

-  5.1 --- Installing VirtualGL on Linux

-  6.1 --- Granting Access to the 3D X Server

And see also:

-  9.1 --- Using VirtualGL with an X Proxy on the Same Server

For more advanced configuration, such as using a remote application
server with VGL Transport, see the following sections:

-  6.3 --- SSH Server Configuration

-  8 --- Using VirtualGL with the VGL Transport
