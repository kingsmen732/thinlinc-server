Installing the Windows client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the client on a Windows machine, unpack the client bundle and
enter the :file:`client-windows` directory. Then click on the file
:file:`tl-x.y.z-client-windows.exe` and follow the instructions.

You will also find unpacked versions of the ThinLinc Windows client,
both 32-bit and 64-bit, under the :file:`tl-x.y.z-client-windows-x86`
and :file:`tl-x.y.z-client-windows-x64` directories. It makes it
possible to run the client directly from the bundle or other media, like
a portable application, without the requirement of installing the
client.

For more information about how to configure the client, read
:ref:`clientconf`.

.. _windowsclientsrun:

Running the Windows client

To start the client you select it from the Start menu.
