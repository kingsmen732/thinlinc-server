                 enabled distributions, including optional local policy
                 modifications and instructions for reapplying
                 ThinLinc's SELinux policy changes.

SELinux enabled distributions
-----------------------------

ThinLinc is designed to run with reference SELinux policy and users in
the unconfined context. It is possible to use ThinLinc with other
policies and more restricted contexts, but will most likely require
modifications to your policy to accommodate ThinLinc.

The local system policy will optionally be modified by ThinLinc setup
during installation. The SELinux module and other policy changes
performed can be examined in :file:`/opt/thinlinc/share/selinux`.
Execute the command :program:`/opt/thinlinc/share/selinux/install` to
reapply ThinLinc's policy changes.

.. note::

   The ThinLinc policy module is distributed in source form and
   therefore requires the reference policy build environment. On Red
   Hat-based systems this is always installed, but other systems might
   require extra packages.
