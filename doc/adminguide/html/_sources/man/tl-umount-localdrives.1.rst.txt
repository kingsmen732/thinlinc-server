tl-umount-localdrives
=====================

Synopsis
--------

**tl-umount-localdrives** [*options*]

Description
-----------

The :program:`tl-umount-localdrives` command is used to unmount local
drives previously set up by :program:`tl-mount-localdrives`\ (1). By
default it only unmounts the local drives for the current session, but
it can also unmount the local drives for all of the user's sessions by
specifying :option:`-s`, or all local drives for all users on the
current agent by specifying :option:`-a`.

Options
-------

.. option:: -a, --all-users

   Unmount all shared local drives for all users on this server (root
   required).

.. option:: -h, --help

   Prints a short help text and exits.

.. option:: -l, --no-adjust-symlink

   Do not update the :file:`~/thindrives` link when unmounting
   file systems.

.. option:: -s, --all-sessions

   Unmount all shared local drives for the current user on this server.

.. option:: -v, --verbose

   Print more details about what actions are taken.

.. option:: --version

   Prints the ThinLinc version and exits.

Notes
-----

When using multiple sessions per user, the :file:`~/thindrives` link
will point to the newest session that executed
:program:`tl-mount-localdrives`\ (1). :program:`tl-umount-localdrives`
will restore the link to the newest session which is not newer than the
current session and which has mounted local drives.
