==================

Synopsis
--------

**tl-desktop-restore**

Description
-----------

When a user's Gnome or KDE desktop needs to be reset to default, the
command :program:`tl-desktop-restore` can be run. This will move the
settings directories for KDE and Gnome to a backup directory named
:file:`~/.old-thinlinc-desktop` in the user's home directory, which will
make both Gnome and KDE revert to the default settings.
