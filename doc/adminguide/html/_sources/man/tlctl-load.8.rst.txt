   :description: The tlctl load command displays the current load
                 status of a ThinLinc cluster, providing key metrics
                 like CPU, memory usage, and agent capacity to help
                 monitor system health and load balancing.

tlctl load
==========

Synopsis
--------

**tlctl load** [*options*] <*command*> [*args*]

Description
-----------

:program:`tlctl load` displays the current load status of the ThinLinc
cluster, as currently measured by ThinLinc. It can be used to get a
quick overview of the health of the system, or to help debug unexpected
load balancing decisions.

Options
-------

.. option:: -h, --help

   Prints a short help text and exits.

Commands
--------

**list** [*options*]
   List the basic load numbers for all agents in the cluster, with
   subcluster association displayed if multiple subclusters exist.

   .. option:: --sort=HEADER

      Sort the list of agents specified by *HEADER*. The default is
      "AGENT". Available headers are found in the list below.

   Definition of command output:

   AGENT
       Agent names.
   USERS
       Total numbers of unique users on the agent (not only users
       running ThinLinc sessions).
   MEM
       Aggregated RAM and swap memory used.
   CPU
       Aggregated CPU used over all available CPUs.
   RATING
       Quantification of agent capacity for additional sessions, where
       for instance 10.0 rating corresponds to approximately 10
       additional sessions.

**show** <*AGENT*>
   Show all load information for the agent specified by *AGENT*.

   Definition of command output:

   Subclusters
       All the subclusters the agent is associated with. This line is
       printed if there exists multiple subclusters, regardless if the
       agent in question is associated with one or more subclusters.
   ThinLinc users
       Number of users on the agent running one or more ThinLinc
       sessions.
   Total number of users
       Total numbers of unique users on the agent (not only users
       running ThinLinc sessions).
   Memory (used RAM\+swap)
       Aggregated RAM and swap memory used.
   RAM (used/total)
       Used RAM / total RAM.
   Swap (used/total)
       Used swap memory / total swap memory.
   Load (1 min)
       CPU load 1-minute average.
   Number of CPUs
       Number of available CPUs.
   CPU
       Aggregated CPU used over all available CPUs.
   Bogomips
       Computational capacity.
   Rating
       Quantification of agent capacity for additional sessions, where
       for instance 10.0 rating corresponds to approximately 10
       additional sessions.
   Penalty points
       Received e.g. when the agent is slow to respond or when
       additional users connect, which directly affects the rating
       of the agent.
   Last updated
       Timestamp of content update.
