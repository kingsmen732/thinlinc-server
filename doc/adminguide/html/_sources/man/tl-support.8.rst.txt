tl-support
==========

Synopsis
--------

**tl-support** [**-p** <*listen-port*>] [**-u** <*user*>] [*host*\ [**:**\ *port*]]

Description
-----------

The :program:`tl-support` command can be used to enable a support
technician to log in to your ThinLinc server, even though the server is
behind a firewall that doesn't allow connections to the ssh port. This
is accomplished by opening a ssh connection from the server to an
external server on the internet, at the same time setting up a tunnel
from the remote host to the local host's ssh port. The default server to
connect to is "support.thinlinc.com" with the default username
"support". This command should only be used after contacting your
ThinLinc support technician.

If *host* is not specified, "support.thinlinc.com" is assumed.

Options
-------

.. option:: -h, --help

   Prints a short help text and exits.

.. option:: -p listen-port, --port=listen-port

   The remote port to listen on. If not specified, a random port will be
   used.

.. option:: -u user, --user=user

   Username to connect as. The default is "support".

.. option:: --version

   Prints the ThinLinc version and exits.
