tl-single-app
=============

Synopsis
--------

**tl-single-app** <*command*> [*args*]

Description
-----------

The :program:`tl-single-app` command can be used to execute a single
application in a ThinLinc session. A window manager with a suitable
configuration is automatically started. All top-level windows are
automatically maximized. Window titles are displayed in the title bar of
the ThinLinc client, not in the ThinLinc session. The client close
button will disconnect the session as usual. Inner close buttons
closes application windows. The :program:`tl-single-app` command can be
specified as a client supplied start program (see
:ref:`configuration_start_program`), or used with the ThinLinc profile
selector (see :ref:`configuration_config-profiles`).

.. tip::

   If the application opens multiple top-level windows, you can switch
   between them by clicking on the application icon in the top-left
   corner.
