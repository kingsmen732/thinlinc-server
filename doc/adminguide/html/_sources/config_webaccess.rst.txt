   :description: Overview of configuration parameters for the ThinLinc
                 Web Access client, including TLS encryption settings,
                 login page redirection, and logging configuration.

.. _configuration_tlwebaccess:

.. server-config-folder:: /webaccess

Parameters in /webaccess/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section, we will describe all the parameters currently used by
the ThinLinc Web Access client. These configuration parameters reside
in :file:`/opt/thinlinc/etc/conf.d/webaccess.hconf`.

.. server-config:: /webaccess/cert

   The path to the certificate file to be used for TLS encryption.

   .. note::

      This certificate may be downloaded by connecting clients to be
      installed in their browsers. Make sure that this file does not
      contain a private key.

.. server-config:: /webaccess/certkey

   The path to the certificate private key file used for TLS encryption.

.. server-config:: /webaccess/login_page

   The URL which is used to redirect back to the Web Access login page
   on the master server. The default value is ``/``, which redirects to
   the current server. This parameter needs to be changed when ThinLinc
   Web Access is used in a cluster setup.

.. server-config:: /webaccess/listen_port

   The local port for this service to listen on. The default port used
   is ``300``.

.. server-config:: /webaccess/gnutls_priority

   The GnuTLS priority string is used to select the order and
   availability of TLS versions, ciphers, key exchange, MAC,
   compression, signature and elliptic curve algorithms for TLS
   sessions. See :ref:`gnutls-priorities` for possible values.

.. server-config:: /webaccess/server_tokens

   If set to ``true``, Web Access includes the ThinLinc version,
   as well as Python version information in the "Server" response header
   field. If set to ``false``, the "Server" response header will not
   include any version information. The default value is ``true``.

   .. note::

      Disabling server_tokens might make it easier to work with some
      security scanners that raise alerts when this type of version
      information is included. But note that hiding version information
      does nothing to make your server more secure.

.. server-config-folder:: /webaccess/hsts

.. server-config:: /webaccess/hsts/policy

   Note the warnings about enabling HSTS policy, see
   :ref:`configuring_hsts_header`. The results should be considered
   permanent once enabled and are difficult to reverse. The only way to
   disable the HSTS policy is to wait for the specified duration, as
   described below, to pass until visiting the domain again.

   - ``Off``: The default value. The HSTS header will not be sent.
   - ``Testing``: Before setting the policy to permanent, it is
     recommended to test if the policy works for the intended domains to
     verify they support HTTPS. This value indicates to the browser that
     it should only remember this domain for 10 minutes.
   - ``Permanent``: This value indicates that browsers will remember
     this domain for 2 years. This duration is refreshed every time a
     domain is revisited, which is why it should be viewed as permanent.

.. server-config:: /webaccess/hsts/subdomains_included

   The HSTS policy will be applied to the included subdomains of the
   ThinLinc host if enabled.

   .. note::

      It is recommended to verify that all subdomains support HTTPS
      before enabling this. In order to verify, set ``policy=testing``,
      restart the service and  then visit Web Access in the browser to
      enable the HSTS policy.

.. server-config:: /webaccess/hsts/allow_browser_preload

   *Requirements:* ``policy=permanent`` and ``subdomains_included=true``

   With ``allow_browser_preload`` enabled, it is indicated to the
   browser that the intention is to add the domain, and subdomains, to
   the browsersâ€™ lists. This would result in the HSTS policy being
   enabled at the first visit to the domain or subdomain.

   .. note::

      Only use this option if you are sure to support HTTPS for domains
      and subdomains. It may be difficult to remove domains and
      subdomains from the preload list.

.. server-config:: /webaccess/logging/logfile

   The file to use for logging tlwebaccess messages. By default, this is
   :file:`/var/log/tlwebaccess.log`.
