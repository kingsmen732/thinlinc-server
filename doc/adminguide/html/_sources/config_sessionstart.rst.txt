   :description: Configuration parameters for ThinLinc session startup,
                 including background settings and keyboard layout.

.. _configuration_sessionstart:

.. server-config-folder:: /sessionstart

Parameters in /sessionstart/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section, we will describe all the parameters currently used by
the session startup scripts. These configuration parameters reside in
:file:`/opt/thinlinc/etc/conf.d/sessionstart.hconf`.

.. server-config:: /sessionstart/background_color

   The initial color of the background that is set early during session
   startup. The default color is white.

.. server-config:: /sessionstart/background_image

   A PNG used as the initial background. The image will always be zoomed
   to fit each individual monitor. The default is a ThinLinc- branded
   image.

   An empty value will disable the background image. If no image is
   set, or if the image contains transparency then the color set by
   :servconf:`/sessionstart/background_color` will shine through.

.. server-config:: /sessionstart/keyboard_layout

   The default virtual keyboard layout used by Xvnc. The protocol is not
   dependent on this being configured, but some applications can
   misbehave if a different virtual layout is configured compared to the
   real keyboard layout on the client device.

   A list of possible keyboard layouts is given by this command:

   .. code:: console

      $ man /opt/thinlinc/share/man/man7/xkeyboard-config.7
