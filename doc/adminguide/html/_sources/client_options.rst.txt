Client configuration
--------------------

To configure the ThinLinc client you press the button labeled
:guilabel:`Options...` in the client window. That brings up the client
options window. This window contains several pages of settings, ordered
in tab sets. The following sections will describe each of these pages
and all individual settings.

When a user presses the :guilabel:`OK` button, all the current settings
in the options window is saved. For more information about the config
file format, see :ref:`clientconf`.
