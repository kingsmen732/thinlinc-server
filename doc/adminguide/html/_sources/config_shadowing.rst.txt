   :description: Configuration options for controlling session shadowing
                 in ThinLinc, including permissions and notification
                 settings.

.. _configuration_shadowing:

.. server-config-folder:: /shadowing

Parameters in /shadowing/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section, we will describe all the parameters currently used by
the shadowing feature. These configuration parameters reside in
:file:`/opt/thinlinc/etc/conf.d/shadowing.hconf`.

.. server-config:: /shadowing/allowed_shadowers

   A space-separated list of users and/or groups that are allowed to
   shadow other users. Group names are prefixed with ``+`` sign. Please
   note that these users will gain full access to other users' sessions.
   See :ref:`shadowing` for more information.

.. server-config:: /shadowing/shadowing_mode

   A constant string value of ``reject``, ``silent``, ``notify``, or
   ``ask``. This value configures in which way a shadowing request is
   handled.

   ``reject``
      All shadowing requests are rejected. You should set this if you
      want to disable the shadowing feature.

   ``silent``
      All shadowing requests are accepted and the user will not be
      notified about being shadowed.

   ``notify``
      All shadowing requests are accepted and a message box will be
      shown to notify the user when the shadowing starts and when the
      shadowing ends.

   ``ask``
      Shows a dialog to the user and gives him the full control of
      deciding to accept or reject the shadowing request. If the request
      timeout is reached without the user making a decision then the
      shadowing request will be rejected. Like for notify the user is
      also informed when the shadowing ends.

   See :ref:`shadowing` for more information.
