.. _tlwebadm:

Administration of ThinLinc using the web administration interface
=================================================================

Introduction
------------

This chapter describes the web-based ThinLinc administration interface
called tlwebadm. This administration interface is installed
automatically by the ThinLinc installation program, and may be accessed
by pointing your web browser to ``https://<hostname>:1010``.

The default username for logging in to tlwebadm is ``admin``, and the
password is as specified during installation (or in the case of
automated installs, as specified in the :ref:`answers file
<install_automatic>`).

For information on configuring tlwebadm, for example setting a password
or changing the default port, see :ref:`configuration_tlwebadm`.

.. note::

   A password must be set and the tlwebadm service restarted before use.

Modules
-------

The tlwebadm interface consists of several modules which address
different aspects of ThinLinc configuration:

-  :guilabel:`System health`, for viewing information about ThinLinc
   master, agent and Web Access services, and testing user or group
   lookup performance. See :ref:`tlwebadm_system_health` below.

-  :guilabel:`Status`, for viewing information such as license usage,
   server load and sessions. See :ref:`tlwebadm_status` below.

-  :guilabel:`VSM`, for viewing information and managing ThinLinc
   subclusters, the master service and the agent service. See
   :ref:`tlwebadm_vsm` below.

-  :guilabel:`Profiles`, for viewing and configuring profiles. See
   :ref:`tlwebadm_profiles` below.

-  :guilabel:`Locations`, for viewing and configuring printers and
   terminal locations. See :ref:`tlwebadm_locations` below.

-  :guilabel:`Desktop customizer`, for configuring desktops. See
   :ref:`tlwebadm_tldc` below.

   information.
