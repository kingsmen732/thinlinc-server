Uninstalling the ThinLinc server
================================

Contrary to the installation process, there is no formal server
uninstall script. As a substitute, the ThinLinc server may readily be
uninstalled via command line by referring to the package
'thinlinc-server', using the package manager native to the system. For
instance, on an RPM-based system that would entail

.. code:: console

   $ sudo dnf remove thinlinc-server

Depending on the Linux distribution, it is possible that some
server-related files may linger in :file:`/opt/thinlinc/` after
uninstall. To completely purge these, one may freely remove this
directory.

However, note that client-related files are distributed in parallel with
server-related files in this directory tree. Hence, in the presence of a
client installation, it is ill-advised to remove :file:`/opt/thinlinc/`
indiscriminately.
