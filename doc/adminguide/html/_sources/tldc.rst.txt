Building custom Linux desktops with the ThinLinc desktop customizer
===================================================================

In this chapter, we will document how to create custom desktops for
ThinLinc users using the ThinLinc desktop customizer (TLDC). TLDC relies
on `freedesktop.org`_'s standard and desktop environments like `MATE`_
and `Xfce`_ are examples of desktops that can be used in combination
with TLDC.

Note that TLDC does not work with some desktop environments such as
`GNOME Shell (GNOME 3)`_ since it does not have a traditional
application menu.

The TLDC's core functionality is to build the application menus based on
factors such as group membership, username and ThinLinc Profile. It can
also add icons to the desktop of each user, based on the same premises.
