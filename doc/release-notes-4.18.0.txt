ThinLinc 4.18.0 release notes
=============================

Introduction
============

Cendio are proud to present ThinLinc 4.18.0, with more than 40
enhancements and fixes. The most prominent changes are:

* It is now possible to limit the maximum number of users per agent.
  This can be used in scenarios where resources on the agents are
  limited and denying access to the ThinLinc cluster is preferred over
  exceeding those limits.

* It is now possible to configure HTTP Strict Transport Security for
  ThinLinc Web Administration and Web Access. By enforcing encrypted
  connections for a domain, an admin can feel safer and meet external
  safety requirements.

ThinLinc works on most modern Linux distributions and is supported on
any platform that fulfills our documented requirements.

Changes in this release
=======================

In the list below, the bug number is given in parentheses. For more
information, visit https://bugzilla.cendio.com.

Server
------

* It is now possible to limit the maximum number of users per agent.
  This can be used in scenarios where resources on the agents are
  limited and denying access to the ThinLinc cluster is preferred over
  exceeding those limits. (284)

* It is now possible to configure HTTP Strict Transport Security for
  ThinLinc Web Administration and Web Access. By enforcing encrypted
  connections for a domain, an admin can feel safer and meet external
  safety requirements. (7948)

* The security policy for ThinLinc Web Administration and Web Access has
  been adjusted to conform with current best practices. As a result, it
  is no longer possible to embed these in other web pages using iframes.
  (8400)

* It is now possible to hide the version information in HTTP responses
  from ThinLinc Web Administration and Web Access. This provides no
  added security, but may be required to silence overzealous security
  scanners. (8319)

* Periodic updates of the license statistics graphs in ThinLinc Web
  Administration are now handled by a systemd timer instead of a cron
  job. This means that cron is no longer an implicit dependency for the
  ThinLinc server. (8104)

* Clicking links in the graphical ThinLinc installer or ThinLinc setup
  now places the URL in the clipboard. This allows it to more easily be
  pasted into a web browser. (8468)

*  Fixed multiple vulnerabilities where a malicious application could
   cause the X server to crash or execute arbitrary code.
   [CVE-2023-6816, CVE-2024-0229, CVE-2024-21885, CVE-2024-21886,
   CVE-2024-0408, CVE-2024-0409, CVE-2024-31080, CVE-2024-31081,
   CVE-2024-31082, CVE-2024-31083, CVE-2024-9632] (8379, 8439)

Native client
-------------

* Fixed an issue where the client would fail to reconnect to a session
  that used a client specified start command. (8323)

* Fixed an issue on macOS where the client would, in some cases,
  not respect the system language settings. (7167)

* Fixed a bug where the key in the top-left corner, next to 1, didn't
  work in certain layouts on macOS. (8414)

Administration
--------------

* It is now possible to set agent_hostname from ThinLinc setup. This is
  useful when ThinLinc needs to be accessed from outside the local
  network. (6144)

Documentation
-------------

* Restructured and rewrote chapters in the ThinLinc Administrator's
  Guide covering the initial installation and setup of ThinLinc, making
  them more coherent and easier to understand. (8321, 1655, 4448, 8405,
  5389, 7884)

* Rewrote the two introductory chapters "Introduction" and "ThinLinc
  architecture" in the ThinLinc Administrator's Guide to better
  summarize ThinLinc and its architecture. (8320)

Configuration changes
=====================

New
---

* New parameter: `/vsmserver/subclusters/<name>/max_users_per_agent`.
  Controls the maximum concurrent users allowed per agent within a
  subcluster.

* New parameter: `/webaccess/server_tokens`. Controls whether Python
  and ThinLinc version should be sent in response headers.

* New parameter: `/tlwebadm/server_tokens`. Controls whether Python and
  ThinLinc version should be sent in response headers.

* New configuration folder: `/webaccess/hsts/`. Holds settings relating
  to HTTP Strict Transport Security for Web Access.

* New configuration folder: `/tlwebadm/hsts/`. Holds settings relating
  to HTTP Strict Transport Security for Web Administration.

A complete configuration reference can be found in the ThinLinc
Administrators Guide.
